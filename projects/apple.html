                <p>My primary motivation to create this case study was the frustration I felt when using Apple Music
                    compared to Spotify. I
                    had used both before and gone through a bit of an on and off cycle with both products. Throughout
                    this time I noticed
                    many differences between them that made one better than the other. Unfortunately, Spotify was the
                    service I preferred.
                    This is unfortunate only because I am a die-hard Apple fan and user. I’ve wanted so badly to use
                    Apple Music because of
                    its tight integration with iOS but I can’t overlook its downfalls when putting head to head with the
                    competition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Along with this, among peers and friends, Spotify was the preferred choice. I didn’t have to look
                    hard to find someone
                    using Spotify who was also using an iPhone. Just walking down any hallway all I needed to do was
                    glance at someone who
                    was on their phone listening to music and 8 out of 10 times it would be Spotify. This made me wonder
                    why would someone,
                    who bought into the Apple ecosystem with an iPhone, still choose a music service that required
                    multiple steps to set up
                    and pay for outside of the native Music app.
                </p>
                <p>Throughout this study, I’ll look for answers to issues that Apple has created with their On-Demand
                    Music service Apple
                    Music. Along with how Apple can create features to entice more of the 18–24 year old age group to
                    switch from Spotify.
                </p>
                <div class="seperator"></div>
                <p>
                    The first, and most obvious, metric that shows concern is the number of users that are between 18
                    and 24 using Apple
                    Music. According to Statista, in 2018 Apple Music had a total of 49.5 million users in the US and
                    only 17% of those
                    users were in this age bracket.
                </p>
                <p>This is a small percentage, especially compared to Spotify’s 26%, of users each month that are not
                    being properly
                    catered to. To be more precise, for Apple Music, the number from 2018 comes to around 8.42 million
                    users. For Spotify in
                    that same year, the numbers boil down to 46.8 million users in this age bracket. This is over 5x the
                    amount of young
                    Spotify users vs Apple Music users. While it looks like Spotify’s growth in this age range is not
                    slowing down, there
                    are a few simple solutions that can be implemented to put Apple ahead.

                <p>
                    Let’s be honest, if you’ve ever used Apple Music, you’ve noticed the absence of new features that
                    enhance the user
                    experience. The service launched way back in 2015. Since then, features have been taken away instead
                    of added. When it
                    launched, one of its headlining features was ‘Connect.’
                </p>
                <p>
                    A way for you to easily keep up to date with your favorite artists. It was pretty much a social
                    media just for artists.
                    Only a year later, the feature was replaced by the browse tab, pulled, and never seen again. This
                    seemed like such a
                    knee-jerk reaction. Putting so much emphasis on a feature during the keynote and pulling it just
                    because in one year it
                    wasn’t seeing the engagement or numbers Apple expected. It is definitely concerning. Even though
                    there have been UI
                    shuffles, new features have been few and far between. The only notable feature that I can even think
                    of from using Apple
                    Music for the past 7+ years is the introduction of spacial and lossless audio, and that’s only if
                    you have compatible
                    headphones and good enough bandwidth. That’s it.
                </p>
                <div class="seperator"></div>
                <p>
                    I asked friends and peers that use both services to compare the two services on a Google Jamboard so
                    they could freely
                    add whatever they felt was prevalent. After about a week I got a board that outlined key differences
                    between the two.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I looked at these differences and tried to put them in priority order from most to least important.
                    Then, I decided to
                    also create a list of the most achievable desired features from most desired to least. These lists
                    are from Apple’s
                    point of view.

                </div>
                <p>Using these two lists, I created a system that allowed me to determine which problems to tackle in
                    this study. Per list,
                    each item receives points based on how far up or down they are on the list. The first item gets 1
                    point, the second item
                    gets 2 points, and so on. After each item received its points, you subtract the items that have the
                    same name, and the
                    items that were closest to 0 were the most important and most achievable objectives, so I worked on
                    the first two: Likes
                    and Group Sessions.

                <div class="seperator"></div>
                <p>In this day and age of social media, we are constantly liking and loving posts from a wide range of
                    accounts. On pretty
                    much every platform you can view your liked posts and look back through them. Now, Apple Music does
                    allow you to ‘Love’
                    a song, album, or playlist, but there is nowhere to view everything you loved. This is a major miss
                    for its users as
                    some leave just for this one feature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The solution I devised for this problem was to create a new bottom row tab called ‘Loves.’ No longer
                    would the user be
                    clueless about where their mysterious loved songs went. This gave a clear home for everything that
                    you love inside Apple
                    Music. Now, what happens to the radio section that was just wiped away from our user’s home bar? It
                    moves into the
                    browse page. And there is a clear back button so the user doesn’t get stuck or confused on this new
                    page. When you think
                    about looking for music to listen to, sometimes you want that radio. Keeping it in the app and
                    putting it in a
                    subcategory that fits it is why it was moved. Of course, all the same, algorithmically generated
                    suggestions for radio
                    in ‘Listen Now’ will be present.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that our Radio friend is taken care of, let’s look more into the new ‘Loves’ tab. Thinking
                    solely about the user and
                    what they would want right at their fingertips, the first suggestion they get is the ‘On Rotation
                    playlist. This
                    playlist is procedurally generated from songs that they’ve loved and continue to come back to
                    multiple times. This lets
                    the user not only have a playlist that they will very likely love to listen to, but it will give an
                    easy way to find
                    songs that they want to play again without going to search.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Digging through any UI, even the beautifully designed ones, is everyone’s worst nightmare. Within a
                    music app, users
                    want to find music they want to listen to then close it and be done. That’s why this next section is
                    devoted to the most
                    recently loved items. Whether it be Songs, Playlists, Albums, or Artists, they will show up in the
                    carousel of ‘Recently
                    Loved.’ This gives the user the ability to find what has been relevant to them recently and gives
                    somewhat of a timeline
                    of their recent preferences. Having the section within one click also keeps the decision path
                    simple. Does a user want
                    to find a song they loved just a couple of days ago? Great, all it takes is a tap or a swipe of the
                    carousel and they’ve
                    found it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One shortcoming of Apple Music has been its lackluster features. This brings us to the ‘Loved by
                    Mood’ area. This area
                    will create procedurally generated playlists to coincide with an array of different moods. It would
                    determine these
                    mostly from scanning for the song’s beats per minute (BPM). The BPM of a song is usually a good
                    indicator of its mood
                    and energy. The higher the BPM, the quicker the song feels, and most of the time more energetic. The
                    playlists would
                    contain songs the user has loved that fit the category as well as new songs that have similar
                    attributes. This way the
                    user can discover new songs within the category they are listening to and possibly add them to their
                    library of loved
                    songs.
                </p>
                <div class="seperator"></div>
                <p>
                    Driving in a car with a group of people or maybe just with a partner is a great way to connect. More
                    often than not
                    someone else wants to play music from their Library to the current speaker. To do this, the first
                    person has to
                    disconnect from the speaker, then the second person has to pair and connect to it. Such a cumbersome
                    and complicated
                    process that it rarely ever happens. The solution I concluded was to add an iteration of SharePlay
                    directly inside the
                    Music app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, SharePlay is already built into the music menu. The only issue is that if you try to add
                    someone to your
                    SharePlay it says that the media type is unable to SharePlay. Although this is not the truth, what
                    they want you to do
                    is be on a FaceTime Audio or Video call in order to use this feature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The implementation that I would have built allows for users to create a SharePlay session, no matter
                    the context, and
                    share it with up to 15 people. If you weren’t the source user, you would be able to add songs to the
                    queue but not skip
                    or reverse songs. This still allows for control over what the source user’s phone is playing and
                    eliminates a potential
                    headache for all the users. If everyone was given the ability to switch songs, human nature would
                    kick in and there
                    would be a race to get to the song they added.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When creating a new system that relies so heavily on the song queue, you have to reconsider how it
                    looks and feels. When
                    looking at the queue, all users are able to see the names of who added which song. Adding a bit of
                    personalization to
                    the queue will create a sense of community and bonding. The queue for the users that don’t have the
                    source phone, will
                    be slightly different. Their queue will show a three-dotted menu next to each song in order to get
                    more information on
                    it, add it to their library, and, of course, love it. Non-source users are also not able to change
                    the order of the
                    queue. This gives a fair chance for each user to play the song they like and have it heard. But, the
                    queue for the
                    source user will look the same and be the ‘admin’ in a sense, able to change the order of songs,
                    delete them from the
                    queue and remove users from the SharePlay session if need be.

                <p>
                    From these proposed changes, I hope more thought is provoked around Apple Music and its potential to
                    overtake Spotify
                    and its dominance. I truly believe that these changes would have a positive impact on everyone that
                    uses Apple Music and
                    elevate their interactive experience with the service. Unfortunately, it seems like Apple has become
                    complacent with
