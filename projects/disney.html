                <p>This year at Apple’s WWDC, they announced a new feature called Live Activity. This feature allows app
                    developers to
                    create a more persistent notification experience. From tracking the score of your favorite sports
                    team
                    to knowing
                    exactly when your Uber will arrive without unlocking your phone. This is a powerful feature for the
                    usability and user
                    experience of certain apps. It allows you to not have to unlock your phone, search for the app, wait
                    for
                    it to load, and
                    finally get the information you want. With Live Activities, you simply just glance at your lock
                    screen
                    and know the
                    status of what you’re waiting on or the event you’re following.

                <p>
                    This is where Disney World, along with their app, My Disney Experience, comes into play. I decided
                    to make a concept as
                    to what these Live Activity Notifications could look like while keeping the same style as the app.
                    The first integration
                    was with the mobile ordering experience. Mobile ordering took Disney World by storm within the last
                    year and a half due
                    to the COVID pandemic and this has brought about some friction among users. Most users think the
                    process of ordering
                    food and picking it up is too cumbersome and confusing, so they opt for waiting in line, now that
                    COVID restrictions
                    have been lifted. Meaning, that all the time and money invested into the mobile ordering experience
                    has gone unnoticed.
                    This feature added to the app may pour some grease to reduce the friction and make it more usable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The current UI for checking the status of your order is very similar to my solution in Live
                    Activities. But the
                    advantages, come with not having to open your phone and find the button to press. It’s right in
                    front of you. This
                    prompt appears right after you place your order. I thought of the idea of only showing it after you
                    were within a
                    certain radius of the restaurant. But, the decision was made to disregard this choice because of
                    finicky GPS signals and
                    the failure case where someone could be inside the restaurant but their GPS is off and therefore
                    wouldn’t be able to
                    start the order.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second step is really just a status. For the user to know that the order is being made. And for
                    the user to know
                    that the notification isn’t stuck, or crashing, the illustration on left will animate, and flip the
                    burger every now and
                    then. Also, the greyed-out progress bar will have a pulsing lighter grey going from left to right.
                    Just some visual
                    queues to make sure the user knows, “Ok, my food is cooking and this notification is continually
                    updating and is alive
                    so I just need to wait until the whole progress bar is green.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The third and final step is the confirmation screen. This tells the user that their food is ready
                    and where to pick it
                    up quickly and easily. This screen expires after 20 minutes, or if you dismiss it. You can also look
                    at granular details
                    in the order summary. If you tap on the bottom section anywhere, you get a breakdown of the costs
                    per item.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The other implementation I saw that this brand new feature of iOS could be used is with Lightning
                    Lanes. Some of the
                    same issues have been present since the introduction of Lightning Lanes versus what was previously
                    available, FastPass+.
                    Users have complained about waking up early just to reserve two passes for the day of. Now, there
                    are multiple issues
                    with the user’s flow when looking at Lightning Lanes, but I’m only going to focus on the user’s flow
                    after a reservation
                    is made. What can be enhanced within the park? How can it be even easier to use the technology
                    available and sprinkle a
                    bit of pixie dust on every user’s day?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The implementation is very similar to mobile ordering. But there are a few differences when you
                    “Check In.” So, once
                    again, the ability to check in is not tied to GPS. Because you can’t use the Lightning Lane on
                    anything but the ride
                    it’s assigned to, you can check in wherever so long as it’s within the time frame of your
                    reservation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After you check in, your phone acts as an NFC ticket for the Lightning Lane just like when entering
                    the park at the tap
                    styles. This would be a small animation on the left similar to when using Apple Pay. And the dots in
                    the middle would
                    pulse from left to right.
                </p>
                <div class="seperator"></div>
                <p>
                    As I began exploring these new features and this brand new user flow, I knew that I needed to build
                    in an introduction
                    on how to use this new feature that will take up a lot of screen real estate for potentially a long
                    time. And I needed
                    to build a way to disable it completely. So, I brought it to the user plain and simple. When they
                    tap
                    on the burger, where all the settings are, for the first
                    time since the update, they see this splash screen. It gives a preview of what these notifications
                    will look like, what
                    they do, and exactly how to turn them off. The ability to be completely transparent with new app
                    features I believe is
                    critical to building trust and allowing for the acceptance of new features that could come later.
