            <p>This year at Apple’s WWDC, they announced a new feature called Live Activity. This feature allows app
                developers to
                create a more persistent notification experience. From tracking the score of your favorite sports team
                to knowing
                exactly when your Uber will arrive without unlocking your phone. This is a powerful feature for the
                usability and user
                experience of certain apps. It allows you to not have to unlock your phone, search for the app, wait for
                it to load, and
                finally get the information you want. With Live Activities, you simply just glance at your lock screen
                and know the
                status of what you’re waiting on or the event you’re following.
