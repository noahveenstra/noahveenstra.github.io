                <h3>1. empathy is everything</h3>
                <p>After Blue Ribbon Sports separated from Onitsuka in 1971, they quickly rebranded to Nike and launched
                    their first shoe.
                    By 1980, Nike had captured 50% market share in the U.S. athletic shoe market. This was thanks to
                    their very first
                    marketing campaign “There is no finish line.”
                </p>
                <p>This first campaign featured <strong>no</strong> products from Nike. So why did this work to capture
                    half the entire U.S. market? Well,
                    Nike understood something that Adidas and Puma didn’t. Knowing your audience. Blue Ribbon Sports had
                    created a
                    grassroots community in Oregon. They interacted day in and day out with their consumers. What they
                    liked, who they where
                    and why they wanted good sports equipment, especially for running. With this information, along with
                    collaboration from
                    a marketing firm, they created an immensely effective campaign. Taking very simple photos of people
                    running in a couple
                    different environments. The main one of a man on a plain, empty road, encapsulated by nature giving
                    the feeling of how
                    running, especially running with Nike, will make you feel. How it will affect your mindset to
                    believe that the finish
                    line never truly approaches. It showed the attitude and lifestyle of the athlete, overcoming
                    obstacles, trying hard to
                    win. This ad is clearly aimed at runners and defined Nike’s ethos with customers. Because Nike
                    emphasized with its
                    potential customers this ad was a hit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second round of ad campaigns was the Just Do It ad. This campaign aimed to target a much broader
                    audience, all
                    Americans. Regardless of age, gender or physical fitness level, Nike’s objective was to represent
                    that all demographics
                    can be athletes. Nike saw the shifting tides of modern fashion and started to produce streetwear.
                    With the success of this campaign, Nike
                    started to associate it with regular clothes they started to produce as well. This created a staple
                    in their current
                    business today. Nike no longer associated itself with just sports gear and activewear but now they
                    were premier
                    streetwear producers as well. This cracked open their business. From only a niche of highly active
                    athletes to anyone
                    who believed they can be more active.
                </p>
                <div class="seperator"></div>
                <h3>2. products speak for themselves</h3>
                <p>
                    The first product ever released for Nike was the Waffle Trainer. A shoe inspired by a waffle iron of
                    co-founder Bill
                    Bowerman. Although the shoe had its issues, being too tight and didn’t have any support, you can’t
                    expect to strike gold
                    on your first swing. It took another 14 years of iterations and communicating with top athletes and
                    consumers to finally
                    create a flagship model, the Pegasus. To this day, the Pegasus is the top of the line running shoe
                    produced by Nike.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was the first product Nike made that was accessible enough for an average person. Not an
                    athlete, not an enthusiast
                    but for anyone. Whether that be a father who works at a desk all day or a single mother who wants to
                    be more active.
                    Every day consumers finally had access to the same technology that top athletes who won Olympic Gold
                    medals were using.
                    This spoke volumes for consumers, especially runners. This distinction established Nike as not only
                    a premier sports
                    outfitter but also a sports research company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Soon, Nike expanded to other sports, first being basketball. In 1972, they produced their first two
                    shoes. The Nike
                    Bruin and Blazer. Since their release, the Blazer has become a streetwear icon and it has remained
                    constant. There are a lot more elements to consider when creating a basketball shoe compared to a
                    running shoe. You have to worry
                    more about ankle stability, creating friction so you can stop on a dime, and complete foot lockdown
                    so you don’t cause
                    any injuries. There are also different technologies that provide advantages for different positions.
                    This is why
                    creating a model that would stand the test of time took longer than 14 years. Currently, there are
                    three main shoes the
                    Lebron, KD, and Freak (for Giannis). All three of these have different technologies that allow
                    players to have different
                    play styles on the court. This develops a unique relationship between Nike and its athletes buying
                    these shoes. Not only
                    do you get to chose which type of play style and technology is right for you, but you get to wear
                    the exact shoes top
                    athletes are wearing and winning in on the court right now. That influence is priceless.
                </p>
                <div class="seperator"></div>
                <h3>3. graphic design changes minds</h3>
                <p>
                    When Blue Ribbon Sports departed from Onitsuka, the first thing they did was change their name to
                    Nike and create a new
                    logo. The logo that was created was the infamous Swoosh. Commissioned by Nike to Carolyn Davidson
                    for only $35, the Swoosh is now one of the most recognizable brand logos in the world, valued at $26
                    billion alone. Nike co-founder Phil Knight, was adamant that the logo needed to be a simple design
                    that is fluid and conveys a sense of motion. The design also symbolized Nike’s, the Greek god of
                    victory, wings. This
                    allowed for a deeper meaning when looking at the logo. Not only does it have the impact and
                    visualization of speed and
                    movement, but it represented victory. The Swoosh made its debut on Nike’s first official track shoe,
                    the Nike Cortez, at
                    the U.S. Track and Field Olympic Trails in 1972. To grab attention, the logo was colored mainly in
                    red and white on the
                    shoe. The red is meant to exemplify passion, energy, and joy, while the white represented nobility,
                    charm and purity.
                </p>
                <p>Design principals are essential when entering a new space. Streetwear was definitely a new dimension
                    for Nike at the
                    time. They focused on pushing sneakers in the 80s as fashion statements. Some of the most iconic
                    models were released
                    such as the Air Force 1 and Air Max 1. But how did they break into this market? Piggybacking off of
                    a marketing campaign
                    so successful it’s still ongoing today, 40 years later, Just Do It (JDI). JDI can be considered the
                    campaign that
                    brought regular people into the fold of Nike’s universe. This was so successful because Nike showed
                    regular people that
                    you don’t have to be athletic in order to feel like an athlete. They revealed that you can be a part
                    of this
                    fitness/active journey without having a fitness background yourself. This was incredibly appealing
                    to new customers. It
                    also helped that Nike was pushing designs forwards. Trying new things. Being exposed and vulnerable
                    with some choices
                    they made.
                </p>
                <p>From Nike Pro Services to consumer apparel, Nike’s graphics have kept those same principals. Even the
                    influence of an
                    app on your phone like Nike Run Club. The big bold font and simple icons allow you to not be bogged
                    down by trying to
                    figure it out and lets you just go. And if you need a little push, you can do guided runs. An
                    incredible experience for
                    first time runners or runners who need someone to guide them on how to run.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The same goes for bringing back old logos that aren’t used as often. When reviving a logo and
                    putting it on different
                    items it gives the sense of being a part of that time period. Since the foundation of Nike was built
                    in the 70s, being
                    able to wear something that represents that time period is priceless. Translating the feeling of
                    creating something from
                    the ground up. Creating something that’s completely new and excites people just from a different
                    logo style. By being consistent with the feeling of the logo, Nike is able to stamp their influence
                    wherever their products are
                    featured. When you see a Nike logo or article of clothing, you get the feeling that you have the
                    potential to perform at
                    the same level as top athletes, the only obstacle is you.

                <h3>4. futuristic in-store experiences</h3>
                <p>
                    Nike does something very different with their retail spaces. When walking into a Nike store, you
                    don’t feel like it’s a
                    store. The way they’ve setup their products, hanging off the walls, big promotional setups, LEDs,
                    and even lounging
                    areas, it’s almost as if you’re there to evaluate new technology. The simple hangers and open spaces
                    only add to that
                    effect. As if you’ve just walked into your own personal sports lab. This creates such a unique
                    experience for customers.

                <h3>5. top athelete influencers</h3>
                <p>
                    Let’s be honest, Nike wouldn’t be where it is today without the influence of top athletes wearing
                    their gear. The most
                    notable being Michael Jordan. This was around the time when Nike had just started getting into
                    streetwear. They needed
                    another way to empathize with their audience, a North Star. For basketball and streetwear, that was
                    Jordan. Because of this partnership, Nike was able to sell way over their projections of Air Jordan
                    1’s. In the first year, they
                    sold $126 million versus the predicted $3 million. This changed Nike’s identity into a mainstream
                    shoe, previously only
                    thought of as a track shoe. Nike’s became a popular culture must have sneaker. Nike understood the
                    impact that having a
                    prominent figure would have on their business. They realized that people would connect to a standout
                    basketball player
                    and willingly come into the world of Nike.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other notable athlete that has been signed to Nike is Tiger Woods. Nike struck a deal with Woods
                    in ’96 and their
                    partnership continues today. Before this, Nike had created golf shoes starting back in 1984. It
                    wasn’t until this modern
                    era where Nike focused on golf apparel. Through the influence of Woods, Nike started designing new
                    golf attire to allow
                    for better performance. This allowed for the household name of Nike to be seen also on the golf
                    course. Today, Nike is
                    one of the top producers for golf apparel.
