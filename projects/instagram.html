                <p>Instagram is dominant in social media, I think we all know that. What has been surprising is how
                    they’ve developed and
                    innovated (or stole) new app features throughout its lifespan. Truly Instagram has been a pioneer
                    for iterating and
                    giving features to its users to make the platform feel fresh and new often. Because of these brand
                    new features, in some
                    places, Instagram’s UI has become cluttered and unclear, specifically the posting page. This is the
                    design problem I’ve
                    decided to tackle as an exercise to solve different problems through different mediums.
                <div class="seperator"></div>
                <p>
                    So, let’s look at what the current solution Instagram uses to allow users to post. Immediately, we
                    see a full page of
                    options and it feels busy. Oh, and at the bottom, there’s a separate page for even more settings.
                    Obviously, the design
                    team at Instagram did not create a solution that could even fit every option all in one view. This
                    was the fundamental
                    issue for me. Not allowing users to see everything in context seems like a design failure. Not to
                    mention you can’t even
                    see the post because of how many options and how they’re laid out. My other issue was, the common
                    user will not use or
                    want to use half of these options. Scheduling posts is not typical, adding a fundraiser is few and
                    far between, changing
                    audiences, and sharing posts directly to Facebook are confusing because of their prominence in
                    screen real estate. Not
                    that these features aren’t essential or useful, but they clutter and play down the other post
                    options, and these
                    features are not commonly used or used as often as the others. From this framework, I created a new
                    design for this
                    screen specifically.
                </p>
                <div class="seperator"></div>
                <p>
                    My idea was simple, strip down to essential features and create a toolbar for the more superfluous
                    options that would
                    expand on tap and allow for customization. This created a clean, non-obtrusive screen that users can
                    make decisions
                    quicker and more efficiently on.
