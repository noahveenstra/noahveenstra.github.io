                    <p>Growing up in South East Michigan, I've always had a passion for technology. Originating with my
                        interest in entertainment technologies, like video games, I graduated to personal computing
                        devices
                        like the iPod Touch. Continually researching and growing interest for how and why Apple creates
                        products they do, unknowingly, I fell in love with user interface and interaction design. </p>
                    <p>This newfound love translated well towards one of my other passions, Disney World being one of
                        them,
                        where I had been
                        going
                        since I was a baby. My grandparents were generous enough to prioritize family vacations there,
                        and
                        this
                        began my deep love for Disney and as I grew older, I started to realize why. The guest
                        experience.
                        Disney World has a certain way they operate that allows them to elevate guests and prioritize
                        new
                        and old experiences within their park which is unprecedented.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I'm in my Junior year at Michigan State University pursuing a B.A. in Experience
                        Architecture. I'm also part of a UX/Web development firm called <a
                            href="https://msuthecube.com/" target="_blank">The Cube @ MSU</a>. We create sites for local
                        businesses and non-profits along
                        with different MSU Offices.
