                            the
                            beginning, of course. This is where I get to know the client, their needs, and their goals.
                            I also get to know the target audience and what they are looking for. This stage is where I
                            start to brainstorm and come up with ideas that will help us reach the goals of the client
                            and the needs of the audience. <br><br>Most of the time, client meetings are prioritized in
                            order to deeply understand their goals and needs. This is where I ask a lot of questions and
                            try to leave no stone unturned. This is also where the whackiest ideas about the product are
                            deeply explored.

                        robust conversations with key stakeholders not only involved in developing the product but those
                        who use it. This is where user research is conducted and ideas are generated internally and
                        between the client. This could really be an extension of the ideation phase but adding another
                        person to get a different perspective on the issue we are trying to solve for.</div>

                    <div class="desc">This is where we get to the real design work. Viewing design as simply an
                        iterative processes is critical to finding successful visual solutions for all stakeholders. The
                        length of this phase depends on the breadth of the product along with the timeline for delivery.
                        This phase is filled with internal meetings to design multiple different versions of user flows.
                        There have been times I've designed 9 versions of the same user flow to incorporate more
                        advanced ideas.
                        <br><br>
                        Creating more versions allows the product team more options to show the client
                        and get their ideas flowing for what the product could be and what they want for the end product
                        in general. The main tool I use for this process if Figma, but I do use my iPad and freeform
                        often for lo-fi mockups quickly.

                    <div class="desc">Here comes the finish line! This step is critical in either handing designs off to
                        build teams or building the site itself. Thankfully I've been part of projects where I've had
                        the opportunities to do both at The CUBE @ MSU and Avodah Transformations. Each process requires
                        different considerations.
                        <br><br>
                        Handing off a design requires tokens, a proper design system, and some
                        collaboration with developer teams to explain the experience so it's transferred properly. While
                        handing off a site to the client, the teams I've worked on emphasize communication. Knowing that
                        the site will not look exactly like the frames we created just because of browser and
                        functionality limitations. Making sure that the client understands this is only the first
                        version of the new site and minor adjustments will be made throughout its lifetime.
